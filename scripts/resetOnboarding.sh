# resetOnboarding.sh — reset Hermes G2 on an attached phone back to its
# pre-onboarding state, for testing the onboarding flow repeatedly.
#
# By default this only clears the onboarding-related preference keys
# (onboarding.complete, onboarding.previewOnly, ...) and leaves everything
# else — notably the saved glasses/ring MAC addresses — intact, so you don't
# have to re-scan devices on every test pass. Pass --all to wipe ALL app data
# (a true fresh-install state, addresses included).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/resetOnboarding.sh                 # reset onboarding flags only
#   scripts/resetOnboarding.sh --all           # full `pm clear` (wipes everything)
#   scripts/resetOnboarding.sh -s <device-id>  # target a specific adb device
#
# The device id defaults to $HERMES_G2_DEVICE_ID, then the legacy
# $FACECLAW_DEVICE_ID, then to the id used by
# build_and_run.sh. adb is located the same way build.sh finds its tools.

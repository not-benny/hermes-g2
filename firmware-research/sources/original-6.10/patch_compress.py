Build a CFW image for g2_2.2.6.10 with:
  (1) the 576x288 image-container size lift (the same 3 edits that
      patches/patch_img_container_576.py makes, though that standalone script still
      targets the old 2.2.4.34 base and is not part of this build),
  (2) the zlib image glue (multi-mode load_image_z, incl. keepalive kick + buzzer),
      entered at image_deferred,
  (3) a CFW capability-advertisement field (protobuf field 100) plus a private,
      fail-open Faceclaw wake-ownership lease on sid=0x09,
  (4) conditional idle-double-tap dashboard deferral and conditional stock
      Even-AI suppression while that lease is valid, and
  (5) EvenHub long-press + ring release-long-press forwarding, and
  (6) a full-panel 640x480 packed-4bpp shadow copied directly into the physical
      framebuffer, and
  (7) stock wear-state notifications outside onboarding plus a current-state query, and
  (8) Faceclaw compass forwarding from the global sensor display event to the stock
      navigation BLE notifier while image-handler mode 10 is enabled.

REBASED 2.2.4.34 -> 2.2.6.10 (2026-07-16). Every address below was re-derived and
cross-checked; see notes/fw-2.2.6.10-cfw-rebase.md for the full table and the evidence
for each. Two things bit us and are worth remembering if this is ever rebased again:
  * a patch site's offset within its host function is NOT stable -- Even inserts code, so
    each site was located by instruction-window match (firmware/find_site.py) and then
    confirmed by decoding its `bl` target, not by extrapolating from the function entry;
  * hardcoded RAM addresses all moved, with several DIFFERENT deltas, and some old
    addresses still exist in the new image as unrelated variables. They were re-derived
    through the instruction that loads them (firmware/map_ram.py).

The old CompressMode-based per-fragment expander (frag_write, patches/decompress.c) is
GONE as of this rebase: stock 2.2.6.10 defines CompressMode 1=RLE / 2=LZ4 for its own
image compression, which collided with our use of that field. Their implementation
benchmarks ~10 fps vs our zlib path's ~23 fps, so we ignore it and keep image_deferred,
which dispatches on the image's own leading bytes ('BM' vs a small u8 mode) and runs at a
later stage. See notes/fw-2.2.6.10-lz4-images.md.

PLACEMENT MODEL — APPEND, don't overwrite. The injected code blobs
(zlib glue, settings wrapper, gesture_fwd) are APPENDED to
the tail of the main-app component (ota/s200_firmware_ota.bin) rather than being
squeezed into a reclaimed dead function. The bootloader XIP-programs the whole
main-app payload to 0x00438000, so a byte at payload offset K lands at MRAM
0x438000 + K - 0x20; appended blobs therefore load into MRAM immediately after the
current app image (~0x00794324 on 2.2.6.10), with hundreds of KB of headroom before the
OTA flag at 0x007fe000. This removes the old ~2 KB dead-region ceiling.

Appending changes the image size, so this script fixes up every size/offset field
the container + bootloader read: the component's subheader payload size (ps), its
TOC entry size (ps + 128), the main-app preamble length field (preamble[0] low
24 bits — what the bootloader actually erases/programs), and then the checksums
(component CRC32C in the TOC + subheader echo, and the preamble zlib-CRC32). The
main app is the LAST component so appending shifts no downstream offsets.

Every `bl` that targets injected code is computed from (call-site, appended
address) so redirects can never drift; the injected code itself is fully position-
independent (see build.py) and needs no load address at build time, so it compiles
in a single pass. A hard MRAM-ceiling check (duplicating g2flash.py's
check_mainapp_fits_mram) refuses an oversized image.
